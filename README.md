## Project Title: Personal Finance and Investment Tracker with Stock API

This repository contains my final project for the Python course. It is a web-based tool that allows users to log their income, expenses, and savings goals, while also providing the ability to manage an investment portfolio with real-time stock price updates via an API.

### Features:
- **Income/Expense Logging**: Users can categorize and track financial activities.
- **Stock Price Integration**: Real-time stock updates to help users manage their investment portfolios.
- **Visual Reports**: Charts and graphs for financial and investment insights.
